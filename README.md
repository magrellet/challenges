HL4: Token Generator

Write a C program to generate a token based on words entered by the user. Your program will do the following:
1.	Read a string and compute the summation of each character ASCII code
2.	It will keep track of the sum of the characters for each word
3.	Track the smallest and the largest token summation
4.	Track the final token summation and number of token entered
5.	It will keep asking the user for input until the user enters the letter q. The program will display a welcome and good-bye message as shown in the sample output.
